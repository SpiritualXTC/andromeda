Renderer Notes:
---------------

Relevant Classes:
Renderer:
	The renderer "configures" the context and clears the buffer.
	Only a single renderer is needed.
	A rendererd contains multiple views/viewports

View:
	Viewport dimensions (as a weight [0, 1])
	Each view contains knownledge about the active camera in the scene

SceneGraph:
	Contains all of the objects in a scene including lights, cameras, objects.


- A View has a reference to a SceneGraph
- A SceneGraph contains a list of objects, camera, lights. Essenstially a complete list of all objects that comprise a scene
	- The basic implementation will be non hierarchical SceneGraph.
	- However it is also an interface so could (in theory) contain hierarchy with a different implementation



1. The renderer is updated (drawn).
2. FOREACH view.
3.  Determine what objects in the scene need to be displayed
